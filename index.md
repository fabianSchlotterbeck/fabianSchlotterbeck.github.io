Hi! I work as a postdoc in the psycholinguistics group of [Britta Stolterfoht](https://uni-tuebingen.de/de/23015) in [German Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/52) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de). I’m studying how humans process language, with a focus on meaning-related aspects. To this end, I develop logical, computational and procedural models and test such models using experimental methods, including forced-choice and rating tasks, self-paced reading, eye-tracking and event-related potentials.   

Previously, I worked at the [Collaborative Research Center 833: The Construction of Meaning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/2965) ([Project B1](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/10537), Principal Investigators: [Wolfgang Sternefeld](https://www.sternefeld.info), [Rolf Ulrich](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/9568) and [Oliver Bott](https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/pers_publ/publ/PersonDetail.jsp?personId=184569824)) hosted at the University of Tübingen where I obtained my PhD under the supervision of [Fritz Hamm](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Fritz-Hamm-10248711). I also did a short research fellowship at the [Cognitive Semantics and Quantities](https://www.jakubszymanik.com/CoSaQ/) project led by [Jakub Szymanik](https://jakubszymanik.com/) at the [Institute of Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl) at the University of Amsterdam. As an undergraduate, I studied for one semester at the European Center for Chinese Studies at [Beijing University](https://english.pku.edu.cn).
